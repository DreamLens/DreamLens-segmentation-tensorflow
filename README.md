This repository is an application of various networks to semantic segmentation using tensorflow.

fcnn2d.py is the foundation class in this package, other network models like resnet, unet and more, inherit from this base class.

The initial design of this package is used for brain tumor segmentation and requires further contributions to improve and enhance the package.
